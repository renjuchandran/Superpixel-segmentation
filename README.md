# Superpixel-segmentation

  The main method used here is super pixel segmentation. It can be used as a preprocessing task in many computer vision   
  tasks. In this work super pixel segmentation is used for image segmentation. Main part is generating superpixel using 
  feature extraction, clustering and finally merging the most similar super pixels based on Euclidean distance for image 
  segmentation
